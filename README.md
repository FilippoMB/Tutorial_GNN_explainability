# Introduction to Graph Neural Networks and Explainability

This is a gentle introduction to building a Graph Neural Network with [PyTorch Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), the popular library for geometric deep learning.
The tutorial will also cover some streamlined interpretability tools for analyzing the decision process of a GNN.

The tutorial is a Python notebook that you can
