# Tutorial on GNNs and explainability

This in an introduction to PyTorch Geometric, the deep learning library for Graph Neural Networks, and to interpretability tools for analyzing the decision process of a GNN.

Please, refer to [this](https://nbviewer.org/github/FilippoMB/Tutorial_GNN_explainability/blob/main/tutorial.ipynb) notebook.

The tutorial is based on the following libraries:

- PyTorch
- PyTorch Geometric
- Pytorch Lightning
- Captum
- Networkx
